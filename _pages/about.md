Hi! I'm Nicole Linares and I study Economics at Pontifical Catholic University of Peru. My interests cover the topics of Labor Economics, Behavioral Economics and Economic Development. I've worked as a research assistant at PUCP and I've been the subdirector of Econ√≥mica. I consider myself as an organized and responsible person who is always trying to do their best.
